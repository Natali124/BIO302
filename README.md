You will find labeled false positives in the folder ```annotated_csvs```.

```read_debug_proofread.ipynb``` imports data of this format. I also used it for annotating the data. It contains code for getting selected points from the points layer and creating a feature from it. This is already integrated into the pull request for napari-brainbow-diagnose.
